This website has been made for a real Muay Thai boxing camp in my local area Cwmbran, I used to be a part of this camp and have known the instructor for a good number of years, I thought a website would benefit the camp so i approached the instructor who agreed that they would benefit.

## User Experience (UX)

---

This site has been designed and developed mobile first due to the bootstrap framework being a mobile first framework.

The idea for this site was the result of a brainstorming session and the desire to work on a real world project, i used to attend the camp and always used to think that it could have done with a website for scheduling and payment methods. After getting in contact with the instructor he was very enthusiastic and supportive of the project also to bring new light to the camp. The motivation behind the site will be to have easy access to the club schedule, pricing and information on how to join.

### Intended Audience

* Current camp members
* People that want to get fit
* People looking to learn Muay Thai Boxing

* Someone that wishes to fight in a controlled competition environment
