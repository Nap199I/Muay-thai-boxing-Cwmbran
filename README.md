# MUAY THAI BOXING CWMBRAN

This project idea muay thai boxing cwmbran came about as i wanted to build a real world site for my project instead of something made up, i used to be a part of this thai boxing camp and was quite close with the instructor so i reached out to him and asked him if he wanted me to build the club a website, the main reason for building the site was to have all the information, most importantly the schedule all in one place.

Muay thai boxing cwmbran hopes that it will give users all they need to join the club and find all the information necessary, it also aims to update current members on any schedule changes and at a later date an easier way to pay and monitor memberships.  
The intended audience for this project are as follows:

* Parents
* People that want to fight in competitions
* People that want to learn self defence
* People that want to improve fitness or mental health
* Someone looking for a hobby to pursue 
* Members of the camp  

This site benefits this demographic as it gives you all the information you need to join, updates on the schedule and an overview of the facilities available on-site.

Here's the am i responsive site as an example:

## UX

My UX process was to go through a microsoft document that i made, it took me through the five planes of UX. I also had a meeting with the client (my old instructor) to see what was important to him to be included into the site, what his goal for the site was I.E who he wanted to use it, what the purpose of the site was, the color schemes, pages for the initial release and things we wanted to add in later releases.

### Colour Scheme

The color scheme used was yellow, black and red. These are camp colors and itemised below.

- `#ffc107` used for primary text, content titles, nav bar background and mobile menu text hover effect.
- `#ff0000` used for main content boarders and hover colors for social icons.
- `#000000` used for main content backgrounds where images were not used, nav bar headings and mobile menu background hover effect.
- `#ffdd79` used for text shadow on nav bar.


Consider adding a link and screenshot for your colour scheme using "coolors".
https://coolors.co/generate

When you add a colour to the palette, the URL is dynamically updated, making it easier for you to return back to your colour palette later if needed.

Example:

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/ffc107-000000-ff0000-ffdd79) to generate my colour palette.

The `:root` variables used in this project were imported by bootstrap.

```css

    --font-family-monospace: SFMono-Regular,Menlo,Monaco,Consolas,"Liberation Mono","Courier New",monospace;
}
```

### Typography

Explain any fonts and icon libraries used, like Google Fonts and/or Font Awesome.

Consider adding a link to each font used, and the Font Awesome site if used (or similar icon library).

Example:

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Wireframes

In this section, display your wireframe screenshots using a Markdown `table`.

Instructions on how to do Markdown `tables` start on line #213 on this site: https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

### Home Page Wireframes

| Size | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| Mobile | ![screenshot](documentation/wireframes/mobile-home.png) |
| Tablet | ![screenshot](documentation/wireframes/tablet-home.png) |
| Desktop | ![screenshot](documentation/wireframes/desktop-home.png) |

### About Page Wireframes

| Size | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| Mobile | ![screenshot](documentation/wireframes/mobile-about.png) |
| Tablet | ![screenshot](documentation/wireframes/tablet-about.png) |
| Desktop | ![screenshot](documentation/wireframes/desktop-about.png) |

### Contact Page Wireframes

Repeat for any addition wireframe pages you have.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project,
and describe each in a sentence or so.

You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user,
focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve,
and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

IMPORTANT: Remember to always include a screenshot of each individual feature!

### Existing Features

- **Feature #1**

    - Details about this particular feature, including the value to the site, and benefit for the user. Be as detailed as possible!

![screenshot](documentation/feature01.png)

- **Feature #2**

    - Details about this particular feature, including the value to the site, and benefit for the user. Be as detailed as possible!

- **Feature #3**

    - Details about this particular feature, including the value to the site, and benefit for the user. Be as detailed as possible!

![screenshot](documentation/feature03.png)

Repeat as necessary for as many features as your site contains.

Hint: the more, the merrier!
